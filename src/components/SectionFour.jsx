            I embarked on the journey of creating tutor finding app driven by a profound concern for the educational challenges
that many rural students encounter. Witnessing their determination to excel academically despite the scarcity of
proper guidance deeply inspired me. This endeavor is rooted in the belief that every student, regardless of their
geographic location, deserves access to high-quality educational support, personalized learning, flexible 
scheduling. By developing this platform, I aim to bridge the educational divide, empowering rural students with the
resources they need to thrive in their academic journey. For tutors It creates wide range of teaching opportunity
Income generation, flexible scheduling. Overall, the dual approach can create a symbiotic relationship where tutor
benefits from a broader pool of students, and students gain access to diverse selection of qualified educators, 
enriching the overall learning experience on my platform. In summary, a dual approach tutor finding app creates a
win-win scenario.
