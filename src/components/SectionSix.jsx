    <li><strong>Limited Tutor Options:</strong> Without a tutor-finding app, rural students may have fewer options when selecting a tutor with expertise in specific subjects or topics.</li>
    <li><strong>Travel Constraints:</strong> Traveling to urban areas for tutoring sessions can be time-consuming and expensive.</li>
    <li><strong>Lack of Reviews and Ratings:</strong> Without an app, students may lack access to reviews and ratings from previous students, making it challenging to assess a tutorâ€™s quality.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Disputes:</strong> Billing issues or disputes over fees can create tension between students and tutors, affecting the overall experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Subject Availability:</strong> In some cases, students may struggle to find tutors for niche areas in subjects or specialized areas of study.</li>
    <li><strong>Geographical Isolation:</strong> Rural communities are often spread out, making it difficult for students to find tutors within a reasonable distance for in-person sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Language Barriers:</strong> Rural areas may have diverse linguistic backgrounds, which can create language barriers when accessing online tutoring platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Difficulty in Homework Assistance:</strong> Rural students may struggle with homework and assignments, as there may not be readily available resources or tutors to help them.</li>
    <li><strong>Educational Inequality:</strong> The lack of access to educational resources, including tutor-finding apps, can contribute to educational inequality between rural and urban students.</li>
    <li><strong>Progress Tracker:</strong> Students' progress is not known during tuition.</li>
